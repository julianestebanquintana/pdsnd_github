### Project Title
Bikeshare.py : interactive explorer for three cities bikeshare data.

### Description
This project imports data from a well known bike sharing service, and helps to give interesting insights and answer questions about the data, by computing some descriptive statistics. 

In the data provided by the sharing services, there is information available for three big cities of USA. Also, there is information available only for the months of January to June, but the program is made with the possibility of reviewing other data sets, which could include information for the other six months.

HOW TO USE THIS PROJECT? After cloning the repository to your local PC, and downloading the three .csv files to this same directory, go to the command line and type:
```
cd name_of_directory
python bikeshare.py
```
Then, follow the directions of the interactive session.

### Files used
